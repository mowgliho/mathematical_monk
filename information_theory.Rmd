# 1.1: Outline of Topics

- efficient (i.e. compression/source coding) and reliable (i.e. error correction/channel coding) transfer of data from a source to a destination
- examples
  - compression of images, videos, text files, audio files
  - RAM, space stuff, bar codes, tv, dsl,
  - etc.
- axis 1: efficiency vs reliablity
  - efficiency: compression; source coding
  - reliability: error correction; channel coding
- axis 2: math vs algorithms
  - math: Information Theory
  - algorithms: Coding methods
- topics:
  - compression & information theory:
    - Lossless compression
      - source coding theory (Shannon)
      - Kraft-Mcmillan inequality
    - Lossy compression
      - Rate-Distortion theorem
  - error-correction & information theory
    - (noisy) channel coding theorem
    - Channel capacity

# 1.2: Applications of Compression Codes
- focus on lossless compression algorithms
- Applications
  - Huffman
    - in some sense, an optimal compression algorithm (among "symbol codes")
    - simple to understand, implement
    - efficient in smallish applications
    - png, jpg, mpeg, winzip, gzip, mp3, aac
  - Arithmetic coding
    - sometimes, a symbol code is not the best to use (so not Hoffman)
    - scales better than Huffman
    - had IP and computation issues, but these are better now
    - jpg, jbig, mpeg, skype, flash, ppm, paq, DjVu
  - Lempel-Ziv
    - was shipped was unix
    - is asymptotically optimal for "universal codes"
    - efficient and simple to implement, useful for files generally on computers
    - png, gif, pkzip, gzip, pdf
